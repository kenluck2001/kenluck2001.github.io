                <section id="text" class="Article-content"> The holy book tells us not to judge [[1]](), but in life, we receive inputs from our sensory organs and decide how to respond to voluntary stimuli. Here are a few examples:  Managers would have to prepare performance reviews of their employees. Investors have to judge the viability of a business proposal. Even admission officers have to rank applicants. Hiring managers rank job applicants in order of their strengths and weaknesses. We have elucidated how inevitable making a judgment is in society. As there is no free launch, every judgment has a cost. Hence, prudence mandates that decision-makers have a set of guardrails when making consequential decisions. Judgment yardsticks can vary as the effect of some decisions can be felt over a long time horizon, while others are shortlived.  It is well-known that the negative impact of bad science is profound. Its effect has given rise to an undue burden on taxpayers. Many questionable scientific works have shaped government policies, resulting in catastrophic societal decisions. This situation has motivated the elucidation of a principled approach to judging scientific works.

Unfortunately, [paper mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_paper_mill) are churning out scholarly work at an unprecedented scales, and even [collusion rings](https://cacm.acm.org/opinion/collusion-rings-threaten-the-integrity-of-computer-science-research/) are springing up and worsening the quality of papers published in “supposedly” prestigious venues. The status quo has encouraged some authors to indulge in deceptive acts such as cherrypicking and embellishing the outcomes of their experiments. It is unethical for the scientist to overstate the merit of their works, but without sufficient policing, who can stop them? This blog aims to shed more light on making better judgments as part of objectively evaluating the quality of scientific publications (papers, projects). 

## Judging Experience

By divine providence, I have been privileged to have served as a reviewer for several top-notch scientific venues  ([ICLR](https://iclr.cc/), [WWW](https://thewebconf.org/), [PoPETS](https://petsymposium.org/), and [ICML](https://icml.cc/)) and judged multiple science fairs ([Vancouver District Science Fair](https://blogs.vsb.bc.ca/vdsf/) (VDSF), [Greater Vancouver Regional Science Fair](https://gvrsf.ca/) (GVRSF)). The core goal for reviewing scientific works is to improve the quality of scientific publications through rigorous evaluation to ensure functionality and reproducibility.

There are criteria for judging work that have similarities based on the downstream task. When reviewing the works of post-graduate scientists, then the level of rigor is expected to be higher. On the contrary, for high school science contests, less rigor is required to encourage kids, to review works with sufficient pragmatism to cultivate the expected research attitude to function at an expert level in a few years. These high school sciences are a potential feeder team for future scientists.

We have proceeded in this work to develop a few guardrails to improve and evaluate the quality of scientific works. They include:
- Level of applicants: The academic pedigree of the authors of the work should be considered during the evaluation of the scientific work. Graduate students tend to anticipate harsh judgment on their work, while elementary school students should be judged with leniency to encourage them to stay in the STEM fields.
- Novelty: The work has to be unique, but in some cases, it may be the product of applying a standard method to a new field or finding more uses. It can also take the form of insight into a new set of experiments, case studies, and longitudinal studies.
- Clarity: Excellent writing to disseminate the information in a clear manner
- Grading of rubric: Ensure consistent grading for every project/paper

Let us discuss my lessons from reviewing conferences and how they differ from high school competitions.
- Reviewing Conference (Journal) paper
- Judging Scientific Competition

# Reviewing Conference (Journal) paper

Peer review is the hallmark of scientific validation. This practice has been a way for scientist to validate the claims in the work before widespread distribution of their work. It can provide a medium for seeking feedback to improve work when properly done. Objective peer reviews that focus on the merit of the work as a criterion for acceptance in a conference/journal. Despite its positives, it can be a source of gatekeeping against ideas that are not mainstream. We will provide a few guidelines to provide a gold standard to inform the peer review process.

Reviewing is a volunteer-led activity orchestrated by fellow scientists; who are knowledgeable about the thesis of the papers under review. A typical paper needs a consensus among a pool of reviewers meeting a threshold for acceptance in a conference/journal.
Reviews may be Single-blind, Double-blind, and Triple-blind.
- Single-blind: reviewers know the authors of the paper, but the authors don’t know the reviewers
- Double-blind: reviewers and authors don’t even know each other (does not consider [preprints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preprint) which may make the reviewers know the authors). This prevents bias when reviewed work may pose a conflict of interest.
- Triple-blind: Reviewers and authors don’t even know each other ( does consider [preprints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preprint) which may make the reviewers know the authors). The author is prohibited from sharing their work as a [preprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preprint) or discussing their scientific work on social media to provide complete privacy where the author does not know the reviewers. Some scientific conferences provide mediums for rebuttals to facilitate two-way communication between reviewers and authors.

Papers are evaluated on a set of criteria which includes correctness where the findings are validated by experiments or studies, clarity where clear communication and coherence in writing, and an increased likelihood of reproducing experiments. Some papers are not subject to peer review to save review time, it may include: blatant violation of formatting rules, inappropriate topics for the venue, and writing quality is below par among others. The reviewing formats for reviewers include a summary of findings, strengths/weakness of the work, and reviewer’s recommendation which may consist of suggested edits (accept, reject, or revise) or other gradations of accept and reject (likely accept, weak accept, strong reject). Furthermore, if reviewers don't comment on a given scientific work, it might be a bad signal or a perfect job. On the contrary, when they have a lot of feedback on a given work, it is a positive signal and could be any of the following: a great idea but poor writing, a controversial idea, or sub-par work.

## Constraints

The original intent of reviewing scientific work is to serve as quality control and reduce the verification burden of future readers of your work. Experience has shown that peer review can help advance science. Unfortunately, any reviewing system can be gamed resulting in the following problems observed in the wild when reviewing standards are abused.
- Reviewers may reject work and unethically snoop on the idea owing to the cloak of anonymity. As a defense, a [preprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preprint) may help the author stake a legal claim on an idea before filing patents. This may be the disadvantage of the Triple-blind review form.
- Papers are increasingly worthless due to the quest for novelty, rather than improving existing work in a balanced way to lead to “novelty for its sake ”where mathematical rigor gets favored over things that work in practice.
- The “public or perish mentality” has led to inundating conferences with low-quality papers and patronizing paper mills. This mentality is detrimental to the advancement of science.
- Undue emphasis on magazine-grade scientific typesetting work for paper by near-professional graphic designers. This formatting requirement puts an unnecessary burden on authors.
- Excess overspecialization of the authors in niche areas. Most technological advancement requires an interdisciplinary approach to problem-solving.
- Overwhelmed reviewers are volunteers and not paid. Rebuttal exerts tol on reviewer.
- Conflict of interest may occur due to rivalry between labs, individuals, and firms.
- Excessive cost of attending conferences, as it is getting monetized by commercial interest.

# Judging Scientific Competitions

Science fairs have become a popular way to get people into science at a grassroots level. Typically, science contests are in-person events, but in the post-COVID era, there are increasingly online components. Nothing beats the real-person experience for the applicants, but anecdotal evidence suggests that it may be easy to recruit high-quality judges with geographical constraints. A hybrid format for science fairs is becoming a popular choice for organizing these competitions.

Science fairs have the feel of tournaments where projects advance through the ranks until the final. Some local science fairs are a qualifying round for a regional and national fair. Let us consider the case of Vancouver, BC. [VDSF](https://blogs.vsb.bc.ca/vdsf/) is a qualifying round for GVRSF, and [GVRSF](https://gvrsf.ca/) is a qualifying round for [CWSF.](https://cwsf-espc.ca/). The participants are many students in the gifted science program, University transition program, public secondary schools, and home-schooling kids.

Science fair organizers are always seeking talented judges with varying knowledge and experience. These kinds of judges can enrich the student's learning experience. Ideally, projects are mapped to judges with the relevant background skills. However, there may be constraints where people get paired with projects and learn on the task.

### What can the student do to help the judges?

Each project has an abstract to give the judge an idea of the project description. Students present their work to help the judges understand their project and make realistic assessments of its merits. The final grade of a project is determined by seeking a consensus on the recommendation of judges.

### What is the judging process for science fairs?

The student presents their work for a set time and the judges can ask questions after their presentation and assign a score, feedback, and recommendation to advance to the next round (local to national fair). Submission types may include variants of the following: experiments, innovation, and studies where the differences between the submission kinds are based on how scientific thought is evaluated. A novel work will be considered an innovation. Studies are about data processing, data analysis, and interpretations.

## Constraints

We have identified a few concerns that impact the experience of the judges and applicants as follows:
- Some projects are so risky that they can’t be demonstrated in a presentation setting due to safety reasons or parental consent.
- Workload distribution among students presenting their work. There are difficulties with identifying the level of contribution of each team member in a project. As expected, contests aim to cultivate partnerships among students and not freeloaders. Any deviance is considered a misrepresentation
- Figuring out where the idea originated? Is it from their teacher, parents, or chatGPT? How useful is the idea?

## Grading rubric

A grading rubric is the same for every student, irrespective of their grade level in school. Younger students will be treated the same as older students without watering down the requirements. This arrangement cultivates the right mindset of excellence and eliminating mediocrity from an early age.
However, the project organizer may compensate for the participant's age to boost the morale of underaged applicants. The following unwritten rules can help improve the scoring of projects. They include:
- Be consistent with your grading and provide honest/unbiased feedback.
- Seek to identify students who are advanced beyond the capability of a high schooler by asking probing questions.
- Submit scores on the same day as the events to keep every context in mind.


# Conclusions
 
I have made the following observations while reviewing scientific works including:
- It is common to see kids have better projects than highly educated individuals based on my experience reviewing high school science fairs. As a result, I am convinced that autodidact owns the future.
- Reviewers can provide weaknesses and suggestions to strengthen the thesis by issuing pointers for future work.
- Peer reviews of papers can be a tool for scientists to validate or improve the viability of their ideas.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that many authors occasionally submit sub-par work in scientific conferences because of inherent bias in their self-evaluation. Therefore, the authors expected the reviewer's empathy in this situation.

Finally, there are transferrable judging skills from scientific papers to competitions. Consequently, these skills can be reapplied in **software engineering activities** including source code review, business plans, architectural design, and developing better mentoring skills in apprentice-like setups typical in software craftsmanship.
